hehehehehehe. im very excited
😊 that feeling is awesome
the kooks are also coming toooooo!. ugh too many things
:O really?!?!. Damn... so many shows!! X.X. I haven't checked Songkick... I'm scared of doing it 😅
http://beta.venuecrawl.com/nyc/hell-s-kitchen/terminal-5/the-kooks/2017-10-06/3378. i downloaded the app and it was a big mistake 😂
😍. And it's only $35!!!!! 😱😱😱
I KNOW
omggggg. Ok, we HAVE to go!
it sounds like we re going to everything. but the kooks are a huge deal
Hahahaha seems that way. Yeah, that's amazingly cheap
😈😈😈. ok fine. i havent really been to concerts in nyc. so this shall be the year
💪🙌😎. (I've written 61 words of my presentation since I opened the computer to &quot;work&quot; 😅)
This is why we shouldnt go to so many concerts 😂😭 #homework
Hahaha exactly #sleepy

http://itp.nicolaspe.com/2017/09/first-fake-video/
Nicooo how did u get the transcript for videos? do u just download it from youtube?
Nooooouf :P nah, that one is not word for word, so it doesn't help You need to install the pocketsphinx module and run
videogrep --input filename --transcribe. I think that was enough. I'm about to shower :P so if it doesn't work I can check my computer afterwards
ugh yea i read that in github but i thought i could do it faster if i just download from youtube 😭. i installed brew install pocketsphinx but keeps saying command not found. oh it worked. i tried smthg. #tirednouf. its taking a while and gave me a &quot;wav&quot; file&quot; . weird..
Hahaha yeah, it's not that great. Hahaha. Hmm weird indeed... The teacher posted 4 commands on the slack to make pocketsphinx work. Did you use them all??. (I'll get to the floor in like an hour or so if you still need help)
yea i did. did u give u a wav file??
I don't recall getting a wav file, but lemme check. I didn't get one :/ I remember there being a wav file, but it was part of the process... Maybe it's not completing the transcription?? Did you get a &quot;*.transcription.txt&quot; file??. If you don't have it then it failed or it might be still working or something like that :/
ok maybe its just taking a while. ill play around with it. otherwise ill find u at school 😈
;) good luck!!. Hey, look, this seems interesting! http://pioneerworks.org/red-hook-regatta-2017/. I actually knew about this last year, but wasn't around to see it so I really wanna go now :P
Ahhh lets go 😀 i love that place after we went to it the other day lol. Its the day of shlohmo concert too
Hahaha yey! :). Though I think it's not exactly in Pioneer Works. As soon as I get the precise info I'll let you know ;). Oh yeah hahaha 😅. I sent you an invitation of the event
Ooo the event says its near the pier so thats nice we'll be next to the water! 🐳🐬
Yeah!! I love that part 😊. Hiya! Are you gonna go to the Lunar Garden exhibition??
hehehe should I? Was it cool?
It is beautiful and interesting, and I'm definitely going again cause... there was a FRIGGIN WORKOUT SESSION BLASTING MUSIC AND WITH A SCREAMING TEACHER THAT RUINED THE WHOLE MOOD. <p><img src="messages/gifs/10155774884874443.gif" />
whaaaaaaaat?! thats crazy and super weird that it was happening next to an art piece 😂😂. ok then i can check it out with u again?
Yeah, EXACTLY!. YES! :D. (if you want, of course :P )
hahaha of course i do i told you im a huge fan of daniel arsham's work!. https://www.instagram.com/danielarsham/?hl=en. ^hes so cool. when do u wanna go?
Wow, amazing actually! :O. I don't know, I'm more free now (just finished the assignments I had left for this week :D ). I was thinking about going kind of early one of these days. To be relaxed at the beginning of the day :)
hahaha look at u! Nerdy Nico finishing assignments ;) good job first year.. i dont have classes tomorrow or friday so we could go friday morning/afternoon? i dont know if ur volunteering for the maker faire but i promised my friend I would help so if u are we can go before
I mean, this was tomorrow's assignment, don't get that excited 😜. I only have intro to fab tomorrow, but friday is great :D  I'm volunteering as well, but I have to check when and at what time I'm in (I'm volunteering for every single thing so I kind of lost track of all the events hahaha). Wait, isn't the Maker Faire the next weekend? Sept 23 &amp; 24?. This weekend is the World Fair Nano
hahahaha I am very impressed by Roland tho.. when i left he was still at school and i was like GO HOME 😂😂. oh shooot yes it is!!! i totally forgot. ok then im free friday 😁
Wow, really?!?! Hahaha Well, did you see his flashlight?!?! It's amazing!!!. Hahaha great :D. With Sofia, Barak and Ilana we're planing on going to the Jump VR Fest that day if you're interested as well ;). We have free tickets for that (Midori sent an email). Oh, and this saturday there's a &quot;fonda&quot; (chilean party for the national holidays) and I bet they'll have &quot;Earthquakes&quot; 😁😈. (I really hope I survive this semester 😅)
I did! It wasnt working when he showed it to me but it is a really cool idea. He told me tnight hes 37 😂. ahhhhh so many events im gonna FAIL THIS SEMESTER NICO. the fonda sounds really cool tho. i wanna go 😁😁 and dance to chilean music whatever that is hahaha. my teacher announced the theme for my pop up windows class. its &quot;augmented reality&quot; and im so excited 😍😍
Hahaha really?. Hahahaha we're both failing 😅. I'm afraid of what chilean music they'll play 😓😓😓. But yey! Let's go :D. Woooow!!! Amazing!!! :D :D :D  AR is fascinating!! (it excites me much more than VR :P ). (I'm trying to learn this song https://open.spotify.com/track/6K5GAopLZzzg0ZX8k5GWwh )
They re probably gonna play despacito and call it chilean music 😂😂 thats how america works unfortunately. I looooooooove this song thanks for sharing it. i didnt know them. i was listening to the killers all morning
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA 😂. I think this is organized by actual chileans tho :P. 😊 glad you liked it!!! I'd been wanting to play it for a looong time and I just remmebered it haha. Uuuuhhhh nice :D. I'll get to sleep now. If I want to survive or at least pass the semester I need to actually get some sleep 😅. Cya (tomorrow?)!

Hahaha lemme see. (I'm noticing a trend of you recommending always the second track of an album hahaha). I really liked it!!
hahaha very observant i havent noticed that 😂. https://open.spotify.com/track/092vn4ehKRNfBLHGaCkDsq. this is good too
Hahaha
it really helps u code
Oh Gosh, I'm an idiot, of course I was gonna like this!!! It's friggin Rostam Batmanglij!!. He was in Vampire Weekend. He's a genius!!!!. Yeah :). What are you coding now?
OMG U KNOW HIM. HE COMING AND I WANNA GO SEE HIM. forget shlohmo and nosaj thing concert. hes coming the 27th septment and tix are $25
Hahaha ok!!. I'm SO going!. This guy is amazing
ive been coding and dancing all day lol. So basically im having a user select excerpts of text from a book. You hit a button and it scrambles the words of the story and then u can choose to put the words back together to create a new story. Then u can send it to someone by texting them 😁
Hahahaha. That sounds amazing!!. :O woah!. I love it!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
thanks :) hows ur p5? lol
Meh, fuck the web editor :P. But it's working great :D. Though I keep complicating everything 😅. Now I'm about to add recursion, because it seems I hate myself (?)
hahahaha i believe in you! &lt;3  recursion is awesome!!. did u figure out the blending thing?
<p>Not really, I just found a workaround (changed many things, but looks cool in the end :P )<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. Hey! Are you coming to the chilean party? :)

It starts at 8, but we're planning to meet here first (~6) and then leave. (do you have your ticket for Rostam?)

529 5th St 3R
Brooklyn, NY, 11215. Tell me before you come, I don't know at what time the others will actually arrive 😅. (Ok, I think I'm done with my assignment... started to get bored hahaha)
Haha ok. Im gonna try to be a nerd and finish coding this thing before i come over 🤓
Hahaha OK! Good luck with that :) (and send me the link when you're done, I want to see it!)
Hehehe i will 😝. did ppl arrive yet? was thinking of heading out cause it takes me 40 min to get there
Not yet ;). I'm buying stuff to make cocktails 😁
kk cool ill work more then lol. lemme know if u need me to buy smthg
Hahaha OK ;). I think they'll arrive around 7:10ish. Are you coming or you prefer meeting on the party?
Yep im comin. Almost there. Did u leave? 😮
Haha no. But we're drinking a lot 😛
Im very sober haha. Do u want beer or wine?
Hahaha we'll have to fix that :P. If you want to bring something... Beer :P
I knew u would pick that 😝
😅. It's just that pisco sour and wine wouldn't make a good combination
Ahhhh true! I didnt know u had that (whatever that is 😂)
You'll know soon enough ;). Where are you?
Where we were befoet. Near the drinks. Got home
:). <p><img src="messages/stickers/369239343222814.png" />
Have a goodnight :)
Aww thx 😊 just saw this, fell asleep right after I replied hahaha Hope you had a good night as well :)
Hahaha I figured 😂 I did. I had a lot of fun staying up with u :)
Me too 😊 we can repeat it if you want
I would love that 😝. Ur dancing and kissing are pretty great
You're an incredible dancer too, I really enjoyed it. And your kisses are great :)
😊😝😁
😊😙. I got things to do, but I don't really want to right now 😅
haha arent u volunteering for the world's nano fair?. I have a meeting at 7 to come up with ideas for pop up windows... SO MUCH TO DO!
I didn't go 😶🙈😅. (I don't like these emojis :/). Oh wow! Meeting on a Sunday!. I need to think about what u want to do for faking the News :/
Oh nooo 😓 its ok u have maker faire next week lol. i like the fb emojis they re so cute 💩 same.. i have no idea what to do. Im thinking i can make a bot or some sort of chrome extension... Did u get the shop job btw?
Hahaha yeah. I would've been feeling like crap had I gone to the fair Instead I slept until 12:30 and went for a run 💪🏼. Oh, that's a cool idea!!. Dunno yet... Should've had the answer on Thursday, but everyone tells me that Rob always takes his time 😓. I'll just wait
Gahhhh im jealous i was supposed to run today but im too dead 💀. yea im thinking maybe a chrome extension u download that changes ur social media identity in some way or perhaps generates different identities for ur linkedin. idk.. im just spit balling ideas lol. yea i would say just be patient :) im sure you'll get it 💕
Aww poor you!. Hahaha it's ok ;). I really liked your idea of fake news about yourself. And a social media camouflage sounds intriguing. I don't know how to tackle what I want to do. Might have to drop that idea entirely :(. Aww thank you ☺. I really should investigate the satire laws in Chile before doing anything, though 😅 I don't mind getting into trouble, but it could be too much hahaha
I like that idea too but i feel like my family will have a heart attack if i start posting random stuff about me hahaha so im trying to figure out how to approach it from another side. <p>you should definitely look into that 😂😂😂 maybe u'll be banned from Chile if u do smthg too much. thats why im not really doing anything for saudi cause i KNOW i will get jailed<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. https://open.spotify.com/track/71cUqXJ3h1r0Ees6YdENLU. ^u'll like them i think
It's hard morphing your own ideas without external input. so just keep throwing ideas and I'll give you feedback if you want ;). In Chile, in terms of social media accounts, I think you have to clearly state it is a parody for it not to be considered identity theft. Though the stupid right wing parties are always crying over fake accounts and keep trying to censor them. It's ridiculous, and their debates are unbelievable. Oh nice, I'll look into that!! Peter was just playing Dr. Dog. They sound a lot like The Beatles, it's pretty chill
hehe thank u! I will :) yes the problem is im trying to brainstorm for so many classes. and i want everything to have a really cool thoughtful idea but its hard to be inspired sometimes. thats so interesting.. if u declare ur account as a parody then u'll lose the whole objective of the assignment 😂 so maybe u should think of smthg else?. peter was the guy with weed in his bike from yesterday right? i didnt catch their names
Hahahah I totally get that. It's like I'm trying to do something meaningful for every class and that complicates everything... It's a snowball effect and I'll never get everything done hahaha. Yeah, exactly!!! Though, way too many people don't read the bio and fall for those accounts. It shows you people don't even try to see where the info comes from 😩. Hahaha yeah! He's my roommate as well. (I really liked the song :) ). Do you know this band?? I love this album  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK7wtwq9WkA&amp;list=PL0Nvf68U4Kw46JG3v_BOQeCTHT8fiHZs-&amp;index=1
YES! i literally am jumping from one idea to the next 😂 but truthfully i care about pop up windows the most 😁 cause its a tangible project u get to see. Its going to be displayed to the public for a week too... Dumb people are truthfully everywhere. People think theres only rednecks in US but ive met them all over 😂. yayyyy they awesome! and yes i know the naked and famous. i love this song tho. havent checked out their new album or them in a long time
Hahaha, but that's the best feeling!! Having so many ideas that you barely have time to think them through :D Just remember to take note of them not to forget them ;). Oh wow, where is it displayed?? Can't wait to see your project then!! :) Good luck with your meeting!!!. <p>Hahahaha yeah, dumb ppl are a plague and no place is safe 😶<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. :D I love them! And just found out they have a new CD &lt;3 I'll check it out now 😁. (but I think this one is my favourite from the first CD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9PfpmywTE&amp;list=PL0Nvf68U4Kw46JG3v_BOQeCTHT8fiHZs-&amp;index=13 )
its going to be displayed near kimmel/nyu box office. ill prob show u what our designs look like before that 😄 i like it too cause it reminds me of my architecture projects which i miss :). I really like this song tooooooo idk why i forgot about them! i get into moods sometimes where im into rap or into electronic. Recently im into indie music. im listening to Rostam nonstop today tho. its sooooooooo sooooo good and he has slight middle eastern/iranian influence in his music that makes me love it even more 😍
Yay! 😊 I'll be looking forward to that  Aww that's great!!. Haha yeah, I forget about bands all the time and then I'm like &quot;Gosh, how could I even forget these ppl?!?! They're SO great!!!&quot;  Yeah, he has Iranian parents, and his sound is very middle eastern, extremely distinguishable and the way he combines influences is amazing &lt;3. (Just finished hearing the cd and omg I love it &lt;3 )
Yes i love the combination he does so much! I always appreciate artists who bring other cultures to light rather than focusing on western or European influences.   Hes not erasing his culture or assimilating but incorporating it instead ❤️. I just finished my long ass meeting 😅 so tired but have more hw to do lol. Which album?! The naked and famous?
Yeah!! Exactly!! :D And not so many artists actually manage to combine influences so effectively. Hahaha how did it go?? Awww I'm sure you can do it! 🙌🏼. Yeah, the new one (Simple Forms). Are you going to the floor tomorrow?
Yea i agree. He might be the best ive heard so far it went well.. We have complex but very interesting ideas 😂 im excited 😁. Yea i have class at 3 so prob be there around 12. Hbu?
Awesome!! That sounds promising :). I don't have any classes, but I've got tons to do and most of that requires the shop, so I'll try to be there around 10.30 (very big emphasis on the try part, probably will get there around 11.30 hahaha)
Hahahaha but the floor is so empty that time. You'll get so much done! 😉 i have a 9am class in nyu brooklyn campus 😞 so whats ur new idea for fabrication? Not doing the shoe?
Hahaha yeah, hopefully!! I tend to get distrac--- SQUIRREL!!!. Nah, way too complicated to make one time, let alone trying replicate it 5 times :/  I want to make a sign that says &quot;Disturb&quot; and then you can switch plaques that say &quot;do not&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, &quot;patriarchy&quot;, &quot;rape culture&quot;, etc.... Wanted to have a light behind and for it to be tall enough to be seen from a lot of places, but I might need to further simplify it 😓. But that class is very interesting, wasn't it?
<p><img src="messages/gifs/1485899011494767.gif" />. ^this is you 😂 if uve seen that movie
<p>Hahaha of course!!! That image was my desktop background image for a long time 😂<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>
ahhh yea i def thought it was complicated when u were asking me about materials 😂 i was also helping roland and barak with their idea.. it was complex as well. but that sounds cool and doable!! yea u can add lights around it i guess like a shining sign?instead of behind.. yea its the super interesting about AR so im fine 😁 im just not a morning person at all lol. <p><img src="messages/gifs/1485901704827831.gif" /><ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. ^eh. bunnies are cuter
Hahahaha 😜 Yeah, that might work as well!! I just need to think this through to buy all the materials at once... Gonna need many lights and a lot of acrylic. Oh right!!! I really want to get into AR!!! I had this idea about a game, but never got around to actually code and build it :P. Awwww I LOVE IT!!! 😍😍😍. Hahahaha maybe. And we definitely don't judge them for the amounts of sex they have and that's great  :P. <p><img src="messages/gifs/10155785414089443.gif" />
lol fabrication costs so much money. im happy i didnt take it 😅 well u can tell me ur idea one day and maybe i can execute it in AR hahahaha. AWWWWW. Arnab 1 and Arnab 2!!!! &lt;3. RIP my dead bunnies. mine never had sex.. i think i wanted them to be both female so i wouldnt be traumatized as a child lol
Lol, yeah, I'm just realizing that 😭😭😭. Hahaha maybe, maybe ;). Awww Arnabs &lt;3. Hahahahahhahhahahah 😂😂😂 Awwww so innocent. (I've been laying in bed for the past hour just losing my time 😓 I think I'll do ICM's blog post and go to sleep to be a functional -and hopefully productive- human being tomorrow). Hmm I JUST thought about a new fab project... a notebook tray for the bed... nothing related to my current state, not at all :p
u finished it?! send me the p5 link to ur sketch! mine will be done hopefully tmr night and ill show it to u. yea same i need to get better sleep. i havent been sleeping very well like i constantly wake up during the night and its annoying me so much. wowwww 😂😂😂 well we partied too hard so it makes sense why we feel this way. i want a drone food delivery service that comes through my window and gives me food so that i dont get up 😁
Yeah! I finished it yesterday. I wanted to make a nicer background, but grew tired of this assignment hahaha https://nicolaspe.github.io/itp_icm/class02/lightspace/index.html. Yay, I'll be waiting :). Awww nooo!! Do you know why you wake up so much? Is there anything you can have to fix that?. Hahahaha, that's true. Though I'm not sure whether the party or the after party was better 😶 😜. Hahahahahaa 😂 should it cook the food and feed you as well?
ahhhhh this is so pretty!! I love it 😍 i like the desert background reminds me of home 😂😁
Haha I'm glad you liked it :)
i think its cause im anxious about school but im not sure 🙆 maybe ill drink some wine before going to sleep or a shot of tequila my roommate has hahahaha. hahahahahaha ur so cute. both were equally fun i think ;)
Solving sleep issues with alcohol, that's my way of doing it as well ;). Have you heard Mark Ronson's albums?? This guy is another genius https://open.spotify.com/album/0m8wvW3WNm9D7J0KUlbf3h
<p>I havent! im listening to it right now and i really like the first song so far :)<ul class="meta"><li>👍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWROL973r7U. ^i forgot. i wanted to share this with u! its an amazing song from a really cool movie i saw. i think u'll like it
Uuuhh let's see!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTh9IuSTOY0. i think this is a better link
I liked it!! It's very good!!!. From which movie is it?
its called A girl walks home alone at night. its an iranian movie about this girl whos walks the streets of tehran and becomes a vampire if she sees a guy mistreating a girl. its really cool
:O. Cool!!. I'll take note of it!!

Awww 😞 what class is it??. There are soooo many things we could do that are way more entertaining than this 😜
its my class about cameras and color perception 😭😭. hahahahahaha hmmm i wonder what u mean by that 😈😇. I came back to my desk in the shop and saw the words &quot;patriarchy&quot; and was like WOAH 😂 scared me for a sec...
Awww and is it this class that's boring or the teacher is?. Hehe he 😙. Hahahaha patriarchy is scary, terrifying!!
the teacher is cause hes slow in talking so im just coding in the back 😇. hehehe 😝. IT IS! omg i pictured large white men in suits.. but thats good.. u want that reaction from people.. 😂😂. u dont see strong words like that on a daily basis. so u want to put them in front of people's eyes
Hahaha yeah, I saw you totally not paying attention 😛. We could escape from the floor later 🙄🙊😇. Hahahaha of course!! And in a big aggressive font all over the place
<p>literally paying 0 attention 😂😂 im so rude!<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. maybeeeeee just maybe ill give u one kiss later 😁😙. or two or three. depends how fast i can get my coding done 😂
Hahaha I think I can accept that
😊. lol the guy behind me was looking/loving ur p5 sketch 👌
Hahaha really?!?! 👀. Where are you? 😁

Damn assignments 😜

<p><img src="messages/photos/1486642548087080.jpg" />. ^What im wearing/how i feel 😂
Awwww 😍. I just got out of wholefoods. It's not that expensive, might be convenient for some things, even... But that frigging long line, for fucks sake!! 😫
yea union st whole foods line sucks. the williamsburg one next to me is way better :). u should check out trader joes tho.. have u? i prefer it than whole foods
Hahahaha, maybe I should go to that one?. Yeah, I've been there. That's part of why I wanted to go to whole foods now... To compare prices with a little more knowledge in me :P
haha u should then maybe u can visit me ;). yea the quality at whole foods is awesome. i go there for meat and milk usually... otherwise my bill will be so high its crazy. but i havent been cooking lately cause im lazy
Maybe I could go there after I visit you 😋. Yeah, I'll try to see the difference with Trader Joe's. Their pastries and meals I know are wonderful 😁. Hahahaha well, you need time to cook, and that's scarce in ITP :P. Hey, you venmo'd me!! (how do you say that?) that wasn't necessary, you brought beer!!. I really need to start reading again, and hopefully a big English novel... If feel my vocabulary is severely lacking
hehehe :P i really like whole foods pastries and also their fish and vegan sushi is so good. I could live their all day hahaha. yea i mainly cook myself breakfast or just meals on the weekends. i prefer it when i cook cause i know what goes in my food lol. yea!! the beer was like a gift so its ok dont worry about it :). hahahahaha i noticed when u speak spanish u sound really smooth. u sound a lot different than when u speak english to me. i really wish i could understand it
Hahahaha whole foods life. Well, that's what marketing is all about!. Hahahaha that's your reason for cooking?!?! 😂😂😂😂😂. Hmm, OK, but next time those drinks will be a gift as well. Well, yeah... I like and try to use a wider vocabulary, I like expressing myself in a precise way. And sometimes I struggle finding the right words and wondering whether the sentence structure is valid or if I'm just confusing it with another language. I love language and often I use uncommon words only for the sound of them hahaha. Or because I find that using always the same words dilutes their meaning. (when I get home I'll send you a video I love about this). (maybe more than one hahaha)
Sigh. Unfortunately i have fallen for capitalistic marketing too :(. my reason for cooking is cause its cheaper and i can make whatever i want except fancy dishes lolll i also only know how to make one arab dish but its really good!. i really like baking.. hence the brownies when u came over for my party 😂. thats interesting so do u feel frustrated when u speak english and wish u had a wider vocabulary set?
Hahaha we all have. It's kind of impossible not to 😓
i think when i feel very passionate or sad or happy ill prefer to express myself in arabic. arabic is more expressive than english. but i really like english literature. i should read more :(
Yeah, cheaper food is a plus. I definitely enjoy cooking, specially when I'm making something for other people :). Uuhh what Arab dish?? I'd love to try it!! 😁. I liked those brownies 😋. Well, yeah. Sometimes I feel I destroy bits of this language just for convenience hahaha.. The same for me with Spanish. I'd really like to understand you in Arabic and get all those changes and subtleties. &quot;I should read more&quot; is a constant feeling in my soul
yea ill def cook wayyyy better meals if other ppl are involved. For myself, I get lazy :P  but also depends on my mood. its a saudi dish called kabsa its really good i can make it for u one day :). really flavourful saffron rice + chicken. im sad cause my english is stronger than my arabic. I speak arabic fluently butttt i know more words in english cause i focused on it a lot more growing up and read english books all the time. but yea people who speak the same language have a unique connection and i wish i could feel that
Hahaha I totally understand that :P. I'd love to try it, sounds delicious 😊. It makes sense. You were forced to learn a new language without any chance to keep up with your mother tongue (I refuse to abandon that beautiful expression haha). Me too... There are so many feelings impossible to translate. I want to be able to get that. But, at the same time, I like those conversations where you spend time unraveling your feelings to another one. (This is one of the videos I wanted to send you https://youtu.be/J7E-aoXLZGY )
yea and i hate when i go back home.. all my cousins speak in english to me/each other.. mainly due to globalization and english now is the &quot;cool&quot; language but i refuse to talk back in english 😂😂 globalization sucks.... I love that! thats a really beautiful thought. Like i feel a very unique connection when i speak to someone in arabic but i also think its the type of person that u meet and how they can express themselves too with body language, gestures, and actions cause all those things factor into feeling a deeper connection with someone... but of course language is verbal and its the strongest. idk i always feel a bit jealous when i dont understand.. like whenever lola spoke spanish to other spanish speaking ppl or even u tonight with aaron 😂 it sounded so nice. oooo ill watch :)
(and this is the other one https://youtu.be/s_osQvkeNRM 😁 ). Hahahaha yeah, the virtues and curses of globalization. But for them you've got to be the cool cousin they can speak English with!. When I was in high school, we used to change from Spanish to German to English in mid sentences all the time hahaha. Well, yeah, it always depend on who you meet. So finding someone with whom you can talk like that, even if you don't actually share the same mother tongue, is wonderful :). Hahaha it happens to me as well sometimes. But it's mostly out of curiosity and because I'm nosy 😅. And you really thought that? Aww thanks, but amongst all the Spanish versions there are, Chilean Spanish is definitely not the best sounding one 😛
i really liked the second video about cursing. i dont think i ever thought about cursing in a positive sense but stephen frye is right.. a lot of things in life arent necessary but we still do them so why is cursing deemed as &quot;unnecessary&quot;.. i think ppl just like to make up random rules sometimes. yea but it frustrates me cause i wanna conserve our culture, not erase it!!. wow that must have been really cool to switch like that. It is wonderful :) hahahaha i wouldnt say im nosy but i just wanna feel that language connection or even cultural connection. like i wouldnt say i full get latin american culture. i relate more to eastern cultures like iranian or indian. well the way u speak spanish is verrrrry nice :p. idk about other chileans
Yeah, that's exactly it! And it's not just random rules, it's another form of oppression. I really like cursing sometimes hahaha. It's fucking beautiful and expressive. (and also, Stephen Fry is one of my &quot;gurus&quot;. He's another genius, he does so many things!!!!). Well, I think it's a bit unavoidable. And I would even say that's in part necessary (this time in a literal sense, I often use it sarcastically as in the video hahaha), because by deconstructing our culture we can identify and elevate what we really want to preserve. While it is true that globalization destroys everything, it also gives us some common grounds as human beings, not as citizens of a certain part of the world. (Though, certain political aspects of it make every good intention go straight to the deepest layer of hell). I get that too with latin people. But at the same time I feel that we don't share as much as people think (specially americans). Yeah, we're all &quot;latin&quot; and share a language (to a certain extent), but we come from different indigenous cultures and pur experiences have been vastly different.  Don't you feel that with those other eastern cultures?. I cannot tell the specific grade of sarcasm behind some of your statements 😑. And I really want to hear you speak more arabic. I think you sound nice :) (at least from few times I've heard you)
hahahaha but some curse words are SO vulgar and offensive like &quot;fuck ur mom's vagina&quot; in arabic 😂😂. ah really? i should watch more stephen fry stuff! i really like his humour. and yes i agree with that, globalization has a lot of benefits as in for example, you and I have a lot in common  even though we completely grew up in different environments/countries and thats really beautiful. But at the same time i think there should be a balance and a conservation of culture rather than all of us becoming the same culture completely but at the same time i argue back to myself and say the world evolves and countries construct and deconstruct over the years so is there really a &quot;culture&quot; to preserve? rather than our notions to feel like we should hold on to past traditions/values. hmmm yes i do feel a lot different from iranians and indians but i also feel like we have a lot of common ground as well. im not being sarcastic!! i like when you speak spanish &lt;3
Hahahaha yeah, some curse words are just plain awful 😅. Yeah!! Do it!! I even read one of his books, &quot;Making history&quot;. It's amazing!!!. &quot;Making History (1996) is the third novel by Stephen Fry. The plot involves the creation of an alternative historical time line, one where Adolf Hitler never existed.&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_History_(novel). Exactly!! And that same notion of tradition and values hangs a lot onto feelings and history. But it is what gives us a certain code of conduct and is what forms us as human and social beings. It gives us a sense of belonging.  This is a fascinating topic :). I'd love to know more about your culture and where those differences are. Aww thanks 😊. And I'd love to keep talking but I'm about to fall asleep with the computer on my lap 😅 Gnite, sleep well and see you tomorrow ☺😙😙😙
That sounds like an amazing book i would love to read it! i keep a list of books to read one day i should really get on it. Have you read Noam Chomsky's work? i would say hes one of my &quot;gurus&quot;. His book &quot;manufacturing consent&quot; is an amazing read about mass media and its influence on us.. he also has a ton of amazing articles and opinions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_Illusions. ^this book is good too. how politicians choose what illusion to show u to win votes. hahaha we should talk more about it! this is prob one of the most topics i live to talk about 😁 it would be interesting to compare how u feel about it. i was talking to rushali for a while and got nothing done 😂😂 ill try now... have a goodnight 😊😙😝. http://138.197.87.20:3800/. ^close enough 😂 just pick the words u want for sure BEFORE they turn red otherwise the array will jumble it together
Oh both books sound fascinating!! I've heard about Chomsky, but I've never read him. I'll add them to my never-ending and constantly expanding book list (the funny thing is that 80% of the books I buy, are not in the list 😂). We should definitely talk more about this!! It has so many implications for better or worse (and usually both at the same time) and as we come from totally different backgrounds it's even more interesting :). Wow hahaha, I can see that 😛 must have been a great conversation!. Awesome!! I'll check it in a sec ;) and shit! You really stayed up late :O :O :O. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155789800114443.jpg" />. :D
You shouuuld! My dad is a hugeeeee reader/academic. I think thats why i question things all the time cause he suggested books like this to me when i was 5 😂😂 maybe instead of beer club u start book reading club lol. haha yes i agree. Idk if uve ever talked bout the middle east as much as u have with me but i can go on bout it for hours 😂. It was a good conversation but now im freakin dead tired 😂😂😂 need to lock myself in my room next time.. we have too much fun together. Yayyyyy! ❤ ❤ did texting ur number work? It worked with me but i wanted to make sure
Hahahaha I think that's awesome! But from what we've talked, you're far more suited to start that club than me. <p>Nope, I've never really talked about it, because I had no one to talk to about that :P I'll gladly hear you :)<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. I bet u are!!! It must've been great hahaha. Were u talking about anything in particular??. Nope, the texting didn't work 😞 but maybe I did something wrong... I tried it while I was having breakfast :P
Hahahaha i have no time for a book reading club 😂. we were talking bout conservatism/our families and comparing how we grew up last night. It was a really good conversation :). Nooooooo! Maybe it works just with my number 😞 ugh i need to start my projects sooner lol
Hahaha and you think I do?! Don't kill the first year who has no idea how to manage his (little) time :P. Oh wow! That's a very deep and interesting conversation. This is my console... <p><img src="messages/photos/10155790060904443.jpg" />. Maybe it can give you an idea on what's failing. (and the last msg keeps and keeps and keeps on repeating over and over and over again)
Hehehehe it was YOUR idea mister 😂😂 and u are a very excited first year ❤. It really really was! I can tell u bout it whenever we talk bout why ppl are conservative lol. Hmmm ok i put a socket connection in my server and its failing for some reason. Wonder why.... 😭. Too brain dead
😅 hahaha I know. And I'm sure I'm gonna pay for that sooner or later. Excellent! I really want to hear about it!. Awww :/ I don't really know about that... Dunno how to fix it. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155790196369443.jpg" />
hahahahahhahaaha ☺☺. do u call urself a socialist?!. i wouldnt nationalize oil i would focus on growing the private sector rather than depending on an oil economy
I don't know. I still haven't researched the core differences between socialism, communism and the other left wing political currents. Yeah, that's a much better idea 😊. I need to write a lot, I hope coffee gives me enough energy.... Though a glass of wine works much better for inspiration :P
yea same i dont know the difference between the three. My country is also run on a monarchy/religious conservatives 😂 so all i know is that im a huge fan of separation of church and state or in my case.. mosque and state :P. hahahaha just carry a flask of wine to school? 😂. to write for project ideas?. i wanna be inspired and write in like a beautiful space like a park
Hahahaha, you should really see how season 6 of Game of Thrones ended 😂. And I could etch an inspirational message on the side 😂😂😂 And change the content depending on the weather: white wine for hot days, vodka for really cold ones, tequila for when I need a laughter :P. Writing in parks or by the river is great :) But to do it I cannot use my computer. Too distracting and it cuts my inspiration. I was looking for music to write, and remembered this group from one of the songs you showed me https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZwlxoHAnvkCRjsOrHAleU
hahahaha ive barely watched that show im not gonna understand anything!. hahahaha that sounds like a good plan 😂 theres this really good german wine called Glühwein. Its a hot drink. have you tried it?. pretty good for the winter. yea i might get distracted and jump in the river 😂😂. ooo yay music! ill listen to it after class. Did u have any classes today?. http://138.197.87.20:3800/. ok i fixed it.. could u test the texting again for me?
<p><img src="messages/photos/10155790303184443.jpg" />. :/ maybe it's my computer?. Then you need to start watching it now!! :P. Uuuhhh glühwein, I knew what wa that about when I saw the name hahaha. We have something similar in Chile and it's delicious &lt;3. Hahahahahaha well I think that swimming helps creativity as well, but might be a tad extreme. I have applications at 3:45
ok i sent u a text from my computer lemme know if u get it cause im not getting those errors. <p><img src="messages/photos/1487098521374816.jpg" />. ahhh that sounds good. Hot wine is amazing. ahhhh applications lol. so glad i dont have it anymore
Still no text :/ Maybe it's my phone? 😅. Hahhaa, well I already had my presentation, so I don't really have to do anything (besides not falling asleep... shit! 😂). (This song just appeared on my daily playlist... I LOVED IT!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 https://open.spotify.com/track/2iT8h4iK7kYChOci6Ap77P  )
hahahahaha all ur technology is messed up?? 😂😂 i tried to send texts to my friends and also didnt work. hahahaha yea i fell asleep a few times during that... i need to make the ITP sign for the makerfaire today and they told me i get free dinner on friday for sure 😁. yayyyy more music! i need new people to listen to so thank u for sharing &lt;3
Hahahaha I dunno!! Maybe?? Maybe the tech gods are mad with me today??. Oh damn :/ maybe the teacher can help you fix it?. Woo-hoo!!! 😃 free food is the best food 🙌🏼. Of course 😉😙. <p>More music ( https://open.spotify.com/track/49KVtxjMNy8li0sQt4exTD ) Spotify is nailing today's list<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>
hehehehe u need to sacrifice smthg for the tech gods to win their approval again :p. yea ill ask him after. i love the discover more feature on spotify too. <p><img src="messages/photos/1487111391373529.jpg" />. ^facebook knows i REALLY wanna see Rostam. 😂😂😂😂
Hahaha what could it be?? A series of 20 leds and a 12 V generator? 😛. This is not the discover weekly, is the daily playlist :) they are more tailored and precise 😁. Hahahaha it's really showing you that carrot :P
yes and maybe some arduinos and rasberry pis 😁. oooo i listen to those playlists as well &lt;3 i love them. their algorithms are extremely on point. shiffman liked my project yay!!. twilio doesnt allow u to text more than one number so thats why it wasnt texting u - not my code's fault 😄
Hahaha but that'll get crazy expensive 😭. Yeah!! It's almost like they have all my music tastes in some sort of databa...oh wait. Yeyyy!!!! Congrats 😃🙌🏼💕. Ooohhh hahahaha
Hahahahaha &quot;oh wait these organizations collect tons of personal information bout us and exchange it with each other&quot; 😂😂😂. Its such a nice day out!
In a couple of years it'll probably tell you &quot;Nico might recommend you this song&quot; before I even think about it 😅
its gonna give me a nico bot that has studied ur texting and messaging patterns that texts a Nouf bot and they'll just have an online conversation without human Nico or Nouf involved 😂😂😂😂. maybe thats what i should do for faking the news? have two bots talk to each other and comment on things making people think its a real conversation
😂😂😂 AI will take over our conversations entirely. But maybe that way we have more time for kissing? ☺😙😁. Hahahaha you could make it over Twitter and see how other people engage with them!!!. They should argue about hot subjects. Politics, health, war, even fake news hahaha (the inception of faking the News project hahaha)
Have you seen black mirror? this idea reminds me of that. In one episode, they show a world where when u die, your thoughts and feelings are saved in this disk and stuck in this server that runs forever so you end up being immortal digitally and interact with other digital personas. Essentially 'heaven&quot; but instead it was a room of servers.. it was so interesting!. yay i always want more time for kissing :p. yea maybe i can do that but i also feel like i wont get much of a reaction.. ppl will just be like whatever. but i could essentially embed fake within fake within faker news
Wow, I dunno if that sounds utopian or distopian 😶 I haven't seen it!! And I know I have to, but I always forget to 😔. Yay ☺ I think we can always find some time for that 😉. You think so?? Like a spiral of never-ending fake realities?
i think it sounds more realistic than heaven so utopian for me i guess haha. u should watch tho :) you'll like it. idk i think it might depend on what angle i approach it from? I need to think about it more. it would be cool to go viral hahaha
<p><img src="messages/photos/10155790714054443.jpg" />. Is this true? :O. Hahahaha good definition. I know!!! I gotta make some time for it... damn D:. <p>Hahaha I think if you go viral you automatically pass :P<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>
yes its true cause arabic is one of the hardest languages on earth :p. u can just tell me what word u wanna know and ill tell u 😂
Hahahaha 😂
<p><img src="messages/photos/1487198184698183.jpg" />. My spanish^. 😂
Awwww hahaha. I'm about to fall asleep 😴
Hahahaha 😚. Whos the speaker today?
<p><img src="messages/photos/10155791090194443.jpg" />
Sounds not super exciting 😂. Last name cheese tho! 😂
Hahaha they're comedians and have to do with tech too. Hahaha yeah 😂😂😂 and began saying he's lactose intolerant 😂
Wait actually?! Were they at least funny? 😂😂. OMG i have a great idea for faking the news!!!!!
Hahaha yeah, they kinda are :P. Awesome, which idea?!?! 😃
ok so what if i had several Nouf bots that talked to each other and just contradicted themselves constantly with different viewpoints? Not necessarily a Nouf bot... could be a celebrity or a person at itp. MAYBE even an ITP bot about itp news itself. what do u think?
Hahahaha. Where are you? Dunno if I understood it correctly :P
Im at ze shop
😙
😘😘 my bed feels amazing when im this tired 😂
Hahahaha I bet it does!!!. I'm still on the train 😭
U do live far 😞. Ill take the M train next time for u. So u get home faster. Cause i go to the marcy stop
It'd be great if we could take the same one. Awww 😍😘. The thing is that the F took forever to get there... I waited for like 15-20 minutes 😩. When I lived in Chile, it took me more than one hour to get to the university 😅. So this is nothing hahaha
Yea the F and M trains are not the best 😞. Yea i wish u took the L too. You told me! In pittsburgh i would roll out of bed 10 before class 😂😂😂. And rent is like $500 and food is really good and cheap. *10 min. Ur university didnt have dorms?
Yeah, but I love this neighborhood 💕. Hahahaha you're so lucky!!!. Nope. That's not really a thing in Chile. And I lived with my family. Just got home!!! 🙌🏼
I really like park slope too 😍 williamsburg is more night life tho which is more fun. Park slope is very residential. Did u have ur own apartment before u left chile or were u still living with family?. Gonna pass out nico. Bad headache 😞 have a goodnight 😚😚. Sending goodnight kisses 😛
Awww have a good night! 😘😘😘. Hope you can sleep well ☺. I did have my own apartment for a year and a half, but I moved back with my parents and lived with them for a year before coming here.. I can tell you the whole story another day if you want 😉
Yes I wanna know how your Chilean past life was 😊. Good luck with Danny and ur buzzer today 😁
☺. Hahaha thanks!!. Did you get enough beauty sleep??
hehe yes. <p><img src="messages/gifs/1487882554629746.gif" />. now i have to catch up on faking the news 😫
😊😙. Awww. I know you can do it!!! 🙌🏼. Are coming to the floor today?
Yes probably around 4 before my class at 6. You have class all day, no?. and im gonna head tonight to dan's too since hes 10 min away lol
Yeah, almost all day 😔. Yey!! ☺ I can walk you home afterwards 😙. https://www.facebook.com/events/160966904437129/permalink/219595498574269/?ref=1&amp;action_history=null

Hahaha I know!!! But till 2018!! Really?!?!. Awww 😍😙
<p><img src="messages/photos/1487986407952694.jpg" />. I suck at pancakes....  😂
I'm holding my laughter so much it's not healthy 😂😂😂. How did you manage to do that?. When I saw your message (but before the photo) I was like &quot;aww, but ugly pancakes are delicious anyway&quot;. I'll make you pancakes one day :P
😂😂😂 Nooooooo it didnt even taste good trust me. I really wanted to eat pancakes but was too lazy to go to the grocery store. I mixed bananas and egg for the batter but do NOT try this... it does not stick together. Tasted like a banana omelette 😂😭. Yes im sure ur better than me :)
<p><img src="messages/gifs/10155793699334443.gif" />. Awwww
Omg ur judging me so hard. 😂. I KNOW how too cook!!!
Hahaha no, I'm not. I'm just teasing you 😛. I believe you!
I picture u with the expression of that actor's face tho and makes me giggle 😊 Its very cute
I like hearing you giggle 😊. I was trying very hard to suppress my laughter on class, I almost laughed waaaaay too loud 😅
I can perfectly imagine that and think its adorable ☺☺😙. Rushali and I just bought tickets to see enrique iglesias 😂😂😂 cause we like his song bailando so much 😂😂
Hahahahahaha no waaayyyy😂😂😂
Spontaneous purchase 😂😭
Hahahahahaha awesome. I'm soooo sleepy 💤
Did u sleep late cause u were sanding?. <p><img src="messages/photos/1488092164608785.jpg" />. ^listen to this
Not to really... I went to bed shortly after you did, but I stayed up for half an hour cause I'm stupid 😣 And today I woke up early, because I had to cook
Huh thats weird 😞 try to sleep more maybe. When r u heading to dan's thing?
Yeah, I'll do that. Hopefully tonight?. Dunno...stilñ have to finish the intro to fan thingy 😱
http://shop.itp.nyu.edu/machines/laser-cutters/75-watt-epilog. in case you need it, this is the strongest lasercutter and the illustrator template/instructions are below. &lt;3 :)
💕. Y had another idea... Do you know if there's a vinyl sticker printer around here? 😅
I dont think so but not 100% sure
Aaaaand the spray paint is not working 😩😭😭😭. I'll just go buy stickers 😂
😂😂😂 where will u find those stickers tho?!
Just realized I have no fucking idea 😂. I'm reading the Laser Cutter info. Thanks for sending me that :*
Yayyyy. Yea all u need to do is write letters in illustrator and change the colour/thickness of letters for etching. And thats it
😁
I can help u in my break if u need it
Aww thanks 😙 I did the design and now we're trying to print 😅
Yayyy!. I just fell asleep for 10 min in class. Very productive
Hahahahahaha :P. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155794391214443.jpg" />. 💕. At what time does your class end??
YAYYYYY!! ❤️. Did u find laser cutting easy?. I finish around 9 😞
Yeah!! It just makes me nervous... With the power tools I know I have certain control. But this is too automatic. Awww. Well, I might be able to wait for you! Each sign takes 3 minutes and I still need to do 11 more...
Ahhh really?? Thats so interesting u feel that way. I like it cause i trust it more than my hands. Theres precision with it. Aww yay! Okie lemme know if u get done earlier and wanna leave
Hahaha yeah, but other automatic precise things cannot suddenly catch fire 😅. Ok, but I feel I might be a little tempted to wait for you 😛
Hahahaha yes u just have to be careful setting the speed and power for the lasercutter for that to happen. Hehehe idk bout u but i really want a kiss 😁
<p><img src="messages/stickers/531111320292243.png" />. Only one? :O
Hehehe u know i want more 😝
😁😁😁😙. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155794522569443.jpg" />
Awesome! U finished? :)
Not really, but this is enough for the blog. Y still need to make the holes bigger 😓
And its not supposed to lean like that right?
Nah, the lean is OK. It's a happy mistake hahaha. Will you be ready soon?
Yep almost done
😊
<p><img src="messages/photos/1488367204581281.jpg" />. I got locked out of my room 😂😭
😂😱😱😱. HOW?!?!?!. Don't you have a key??
IM SO SAD
Or maybe you could use the fire escape?
My bed is 2 ft away
:(
And im sleeping on the couch tnight
Mine is too many stations away :(
We changed the locks earlier so i think smthg was installed incorrectly
How did you lock yourself out?!?!. <p><img src="messages/stickers/144885159019084.png" />
^we changed the locks 😞. <p><img src="messages/stickers/144885069019093.png" />
:/
Its ok. At least my dress is also kind of a night gown 😉😂
😂😂😂. Luckily you don't have classes tomorrow. You can stay home. I'm finally on the train 😭
Yes so happy bout that.. Ahhhh i kept u kissing for too long. 😚😚
Hahaha no. Maybe for too little time 😋. 😚😚. (now I want more 😁). I wish I lived closer 😶. Got home 10 min ago :)
Ahh im sorry Nico, I wanted to make sure u got home! But I drank too much wine and literally passed out on my couch 😂Im glad u got home safely 😚💕. Waiting for the landlord to let me in my room 😁
Hahahaha don't worry, it took me too long to get back 😚😚😚. Yay!!! 😁🙌🏼
I GOT IN! 😭😭. This has been an interesting night/morning...
😃🙌🏼💕. Hahaha :P. Is your couch comfortable at least?
No actually i slept pretty badly. but its ok cause I had amazing kisses before i went to sleep 😋. im distracted thinking about it now 😂
Awww I can give you more then 😊😚. Hahahaha me too... And I'm in class!! (and smiling like an idiot)
Thats good!! It might make the professor think ur wayyyyyyyy too excited for this class 😂😂😂. did they like ur patriarchy project?
😂😂😂 yeah, exactly that. I didn't show up with it in class, but people who saw it really liked it :). I want more kisses 😋
Hehehe tonight? 😚😚. Escape like yesterday 😆😁. Are u working at itp all day?
Ok, I can accept that ☺. Yeah, I think so. Just finished my classes and had lunch. I just want to have some sleep tho. 😴💤💤💤
😞 u went to sleep so late. <p><img src="messages/photos/1488838461200822.jpg" />. Im working on my fire escape and its so peaceful 😊
Awww that's so nice!!!. I'm a bit jealous hahaha. (I wouldn't mind if you showed up earlier and we could go for a &quot;walk&quot;)
Hehehe lemme just finish a few things i have to do and ill come 😚😋
😁😚😚. (don't rush tho, I have to meet a friend to do the icm assignment at 4:30)
Yup i was thinking later like 7:30/8 😚. https://open.spotify.com/track/6113aOfHIC0vbZVDZ6PpRV?si=K9E1iCor. Listen to the drums ❤️❤️❤️ this is one of my favourite songs of them. https://open.spotify.com/track/2WETO8PgRIdYLW4zz8xjnD?si=mWEjxcgd. This whole album
:). Uh cool!! I'll listen to them now. (again the second song of the album hahaha). And I just recalled I had to send you this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bneJPOdMGM 🙈
Ahhhhhhh I love it so much ❤️❤️❤️. You're adorable in the back. Always dancing nico. And guillermo loves performing hahaha. Maybe theres a reason why the second song in the album is always the best 😉
😳😊. Of course, if you're playing you have to move 😁. Hahaha you might be onto something. How's your work coming along?
Hehehe true and ur hair is bouncy too it dances by itself ☺️😚. Its going ok. Im having problems with my scholarship today so ive been dealing with that. They re being annoying bout my AR class and i might have to drop it and take smthg else 😞. But the drop deadline already passed..
Awww nooo!!! Why?!?! What's the issue?? Couldn't they tell you before?! Isn't there any way to fix it internally??
Its because the AR class is in another department at NYU called game design and they re saying its not related to my major but it really is...!!! And its because i just took the AR class cause i dropped independent business so they just told me. So idk what to do.. maybe call them again tmr? Or look into another class :/
😞 how can they say AR is not relevant to ITP?!?!. Hmm, can you try to talk to anyone in here first?. I think your argument would have more weight if you did that beforehand
Cause its hard to explain AR or ITP to close minded arabs 😂. I agree. Ill try to talk to dante or midori tmr. Did u finish ICM?
Hahahaha. Nah, not yet... But I don't think we'll end today
mmm okie wanted to see what time i should head over. 8 or 8:30 good for our walk? :P
Whenever you want 😉
Kk heading out :). Downstairs come down!
Aw just saw this. Gimme a sec!
K im in ze shop
Where do u wanna go?
Wanna leave first and ill meet u around the corner? Lol
Hahahaha oki
Ill say im going to L
Ok I'll go to Broadway Lafayette

176C Mott St 176C Mott St, New York, NY 10012

Comin
☺😘. 😘😘😘
Got home 😘😘😘
Yay!!! ☺😘. The F is just arriving....
Omg 😞 the F really sucks!!!. So what time do we have to be up for tmr?. 11am?
<p><img src="messages/photos/10155798054024443.jpg" />. Just reading this. Yeah.. Seems they're doing work in Queens, that's why it's so slow at this time 😭. Do we have to be at 11 in Queens?? Or ITP?? And why does this say 11 when the spreadsheet says 3pm! 😢
Yea i know... i signed up for 3pm lol. Its very confusing. I messaged mithru. Ok im calling him ill let u know what he says
Yeah, me too!!! And Mithru asked me about the 11am thing and I told him I preferred not, that 3pm was perfect 😓. Yeah, me too!!!. Ok thx 😊. Yay!!! I'm in Bergen St and the train will go straight to 7av 😁🙌🏼
Ok he said 11am at queens. And i said i didnt sign up for 11am. <p><img src="messages/photos/1489159604502041.jpg" />. ^what he said. Cause i have a meeting at school at 1 so i prefer going there at 3
Ohhhh ok. Thx ☺. I... Dunno what I'll do 😓
<p><img src="messages/photos/1489162557835079.jpg" />. ^read the last bit
I was planning on sleeping late tomorrow 😓 and I have training for the Future of Storytelling fair on Sunday at 3 :/. (just realized that my plan ended... I have no data!!! 😱 #millenialHell
I would say just show up at 3 or whenever tmr cause i think its unfair to sign u up for that when u didnt put it down. Hahahaha whats ur network? I have cricket
Hmm.... Maybe I could go tmr morning and meet with you afterwards? ☺ I mean, if you want to 😋. T-mobile. Home!!! 😃🙌🏼
Hehe yes lets meet afterwards or i can meet u in queens. Queens is cool 😛. Yayyyyy! 😘😘
Hahaha really? I've never been much in Queens. ☺
Lol ill show u around tmr if u like. ☺️
<p><img src="messages/gifs/10155798092269443.gif" />
Hehehe ill take that as a yes ☺️
Yes yes yes 😚😚😚
You are the cutest 😚. Goodnight Nico 😘💕
You too 😚. Gnite Nouf 😘💕. Hi 😊😚
Morning ☺☺ im surprised u woke up on time!
Of course!! I always do. But that also means I'm an idiot due to sleep deprivation. I. LEFT. MY. TICKET. HOME. 😓😂🙈. I came back after taking the G, but luckily I had only gone one station
OMG NOOOOOO! This is what sleep deprivation does to you!! :(. You need more sleep please ❤. Also wow its probably gonna take u 50 min on the G to reach queens :/. I almost forgot.. thank u for reminding me 😂
😂😂 I'm glad my mistake at least had some use. Yeah, but kisses also give me energy... Just sayin😋. Hahaha anyway, I'll try go to early yo bed today
Hehehe i think the food gave u way more energy 😉. Its suchhhhh a beautiful hot day today. Im excited to meet u later and walk around 🌞😘. I wanna walk all the day to school cause its so nice 😂 but its an hr walk..
Hahaha it's a balance And music also helps!. Yeah!! It's beautiful :). Awww me too 😊. Hahahaha it'd be an amazing workout though!. And you'd have to walk across the Williamsburg bridge 💕
Yes!! Thats why. I wanted to walk across the bridge 😍 but its ok ill save my energy for later 😉. My friend is telling me ITP isnt at the maker faire yet 😂. Good thing u went later..
We can take a walk across the bridge one of these days 😊. Oh Gosh, I just got to Queens. I'd be really pissed
Yay! That'd be cool ☺️. Yea shes pretty pissed. Maybe they got there now?
Though it still means I could've slept more. :O just realized Rostam's show is next week! :D
Did u find them?. Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!. IM SO EXCITED
Nope, still on the train
i need to stop listening to his music so much cause then ill burn myself out
Hahahaha does that happen??
Yes like ive def listened to certain artists wayyy too much then i need a break from them. :'(
But before shows?
That hasnt happened to u?!. Idk i havent gone to concerts really. This is my second concert
Oh really?! Well, you'll love it ;). Yeah, it's happened to me, but not before a concert... I like building up the excitement and after the concert the feeling is amazing. 😊
No wait what am i saying!! Ive been to 3 concerts. Barry Manilow (old dude) for my mom. Justin Timberlake in london. And purity ring and crystal castles in pittsburgh 😄. Still not much.. ppl have gone to more. Like u and arcade fire lol. Yes my excitement for rostam is the most ive had for a concert lol
Hahahaha. That's not that bad. And you can always go to more to make up for the lost time 😜. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155799550929443.jpg" />
True i shall maybe go more this year :). Nice! how'd it go?. I just finished my meeting
It's going well. Are you coming here or do you wanna meet somewhere else??. There's a dinner+party afterwards
Yep im coming. Just waiting for the uber. :). We re bringing stuff
😊😚. Awesome. Did you get here??
Just got here where are u?
Outside the building
Comin back? Party s at 5 😁
Waiting for you actually :P. To help unload the car. At 5? :O I thought it was at 6
Oh we unloaded!. Sooooo come back. 😘😘
Wait, where are you?
In the main area. Where itp is. Inside
😅
maya lin maps. Home 😘😘
Yay!! 😁😚. 😘😘😘
<p><img src="messages/gifs/1490515727699762.gif" />
😍. I was writing beautiful arnab 😘. I'm still gigglish
Hehehehe me too. You make me smile so much ❤️. <p><img src="messages/photos/1490518927699442.jpg" />. 😂😂😂
😍😚😚😚😚😚💕. Hahahahahaha 😂. I think I'll go to do laundry right away. That way I won't have to move from home later :P and I can open a beer while working :P
hehehehe strategic planning :p. we sweat so much on ur bed earlier 😂. i just laid in bed and wanna do nothinggggg.
Hahaha I know!!!. We were pretty intense 😁. Nooooo, wooooorkkkk. So we can lay in bed together 😋
i liked the sweating, it was pretty hot :p. yes yes i wanna finish stuff so we enjoy our laying in bed doing nothing activities &lt;3. sometimes its hard to motivate urself in ur bed 😂. ill try and sit on the couch maybe hahaha
Hehehehe definitely. 😘😘😘😘. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155803244754443.jpg" />. So many options!! 😨. Rhino is SO much cheaper!!!
choose architect!! 😁. omg nico i can send u my free rhino
Hahahaha. Vectorworks Architect 2,945 Designer 3,745
Fundamentals 2,145
😱. Rhino student 195...😅. I think I'll use the free trial first. And then I'll decide whether I like it/will use it or not
thats a good idea. If ur using rhino, it works best in windows/bootcamp but theres a mac version also but its not as developed as the pc one. Also side note - arabic words for u to know so i can use them with you 😂: Yallah - Vamos, Habibi - darling (term of endearment). i want to use these with u but i figured u dont know the meaning
Yeah, I saw that the Mac one is not as developed. Is it a big deal?? I want to use it only for basic modeling, dunno if I'll use it for more advanced things :/. Awww 💕💕💕. I heard you say and explain Yallah :P. There's a 7:40 hour Rhino course on Lynda 👀. And another &quot;essential&quot; 5 hours training. 😂
if you're doing basic modeling then the mac version should be fine :) more advanced i would recommend the windows version. wow... well rhino is pretty intuitive. If you want to build a surface, the icon is right there for u to build and if u want to make it have a thickness u type in &quot;extrude&quot;.. if uve done autocad then i think u'll get rhino easily. &quot;extrudesrf&quot; which is extrude surface. yes! and let me know about any chilean words 😂
Cool! Yeah, I think that going from AutoCAD to Rhino won't be too difficult. If I have any questions I'll ask you 😉. And might ask you to show me stuff to be close to you at ITP 😁. I'll think about some words we could use 😊😚
yup it wont be cause ive done a lot of stuff on autocad as well. if you want to build any custom shapes then i suggest starting with &quot;curves&quot; which are just lines then extruding them to give a thickness. hehehehe ill gladly show u stuff very closely at ITP ;) :p
😁. Can u import vector drawings from illustrator or software like that?
yup u can!. u can also export into dwg or illustrator. u can import photos too. anything really.. OBJ
Osm 😃
Whats OSM?
Hahaha awesome 😅😜
Lolllll nico u cant invent words like this
I didn't invent it!!!! 😂😂😂. It's Internet slang 😂😂😂. I was a gaming nerd when I was a teenager 😜. (I'm speaking over Skype with my mom and she asks me why I start smiling spontaneously 😅)
Hahahahaha i didnt know u were a gaming nerd!! What did u play? My mom didnt allow me to play video games when i was little. My mom asks me the same thing 💕💕💕💕. Ended up going to that restaurant the group wanted to go to since it so close to my place.. i cant believe im eating again 😂
Hahaha yeah!! Lots of computer games, my mom didn't like vg consoles. Mostly role-playing and online games :P. Hahahaha 😍💕. No wayyyyy. Hahahaha 😂. I thought about it but didn't want to eat again hahahaha. Have fun!! Bon Appétit 😘. (I keep finding long dark hairs on my sheets... I wonder why 😜💕)
Awww ur such a nerd ❤️ i really like that bout u 😘. yea i really wanted to try this korean food so i went. But i ate too much today. Im gonna hit the gym tomorrow. I try to work out a lot to maintain my body 😂. Awwww im sorry! I shed so much 😘😘😘. Grau is teasing me bout you. I told him. He knows 😂
Hahaha. Well, your effort really shows 😉💕. Hahaha don't worry about it, it's a beautiful reminder 😘. Hahahahahaha it's OK. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155803481399443.jpg" />. Look what I found
Hehehe see i left u more reminders of me 😘😘. I wish i had a reminder of u. Maybe next time ur at my place hehe
💕. I'll about something then 😉
💕. Ok back home! Ill be more productive now 😁
Hahaha I haven't started working yet... Still tidying my room :P. How was the food?. I'm impressed though... I was sure you'd hit a bar afterwards hahaha
hahaha did we cause that much of a mess :p. it was really good! but i had something small and just paid $6. The bill ended up being around $450 lol. they are hitting a bar but i dont feel like drinking and need to focus on my stuff. the problem with ITP is that u can socialize literally every moment haha
Hahahaha nah, it was already messy (and I get distracted easily). I know!!!! Sofía uploaded the bill to her story 😱😱😱. Ohh that sounds more like it. Hahahaha I've noticed. I'll start working now, but my bed feels kind of empty 😶. (I'll just leave this here 😋)  https://open.spotify.com/track/754kgU5rWscRTfvlsuEwFp
hehe my place is messy too. yea im happy i didnt order or eat more.. dan just kept ordering food for everyone and each person paid $34 😱. awwwwwwww you are killing me nicoooo. :*
:P. 😱😱😱 oh Gosh. ☺💕
I would love to kiss you again &lt;3. and ur whole body hehe
Me too 😙😙😙
Ilana, sofia, and barak and i were talking about checking out Mr. Sundays possibly tmr maybe around 5 or 6 if u wanted to check it out too? Idk if im def going or not but maybe. apparently its a really good outdoor DJ
Oh, sounds cool!!. Wait.... 5 or 6 am or pm?? Cause there was a daybreaker event (are they called like that?) tmr
Omg no!!! I dont wanna wake up that early 😢 i need my beauty sleep from last night :p. 5 or 6PM. Not the daybreakers event. https://www.facebook.com/events/504577429876939/
Hahaha ok. The tickets are 20+2.50, but can be 15 at the door if you RSVP and get there before 5pm
Yup i think we said we were planning on that. And brandon said he might be able to get us discounts on the $15. So ill message the group tmr to confirm
Cool!! :D. I'll RSVP then. How's your work coming along? I can't really focus, I keep thinking bout kissing you 😅. Oh, and I think I told you about this site, you should try it out ;) https://simplynoise.com/
hahaha not getting very much done 😂 but im trying!. I cant decide if we would get no work done or a lot of work done if we were actually sitting next to each other 😂😂 which one do u think would happen?. yes u did tell me about it! Thank u &lt;3 i have a lot of trouble sleeping
Hahaha I'm really failing here hahaha  Though I'm still reading lots of things that'll be useful for faking the news (wishful thinking). 😋. Either we'd get some work done (we could kiss whenever we wanted instead of just thinking about that) or we wouldn't but we'd have great sex and kisses instead (so it's a win-win situation, I think 😋). (dunno why that emoji got sent by itself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). Happy to help :) :*. (did you have trouble sleeping last night?)
yay! reading is progress lol so since I dropped that AR class.. the other class im taking is project development studio on tuesday so now my tuesday schedule is: 12-3 (programming a-z), 3-6 (project development studio), 6-9 (faking the news) :(😥. hehehehe the huge emoji made me giggle and think of ur cute facial expressions :*. i agree. I think one or the other would prob happen and i would enjoy very much either scenarios :p ugh now im thinking about it and wanting it even more... well yes! because it was our first night sharing a bed so i did keep waking up. and i wanted to feel ur skin all night long lol
Aww, damn, that's a pretty intense day :/. Awww ur so sweet ☺😘. I know, right!!! Damn G train, why can't you be faster?!?! 😭. Yeah, I noticed that as well. And I wanted to feels yours and to see you and kiss you all over again 😁😚
the G train hates us clearly. there is the option to bike but i dont know how to ride one :p. i know hehehe i think every time i woke i saw u smiling :*
Awww hahahaha. I might need to get one, then. ☺☺😚💕
<p><img src="messages/gifs/1490689551015713.gif" />. ^if i were next to u right now
<p><img src="messages/gifs/10155803816974443.gif" />. (hahaha I didn't quite see the ending with the gif preview 😅)
idk if we re as aggressive as these cats. maybe we are. i so bite u a lot. *do
And I like biting you as well :P And you scratch me quite a bit. <p><img src="messages/gifs/10155803857554443.gif" />
haha pls tell me if the scratching or biting is too much
I'm going to sleep now beautiful :*
im too passionate sometimes i dont notice
Hahaha I like that! 😁 😚. And I like your scratching and biting as well 🙊😏😊
<p>hehe thats great. I will continue my skills with u :p<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. yes u need to sleep! Have a goodnight 😘😘💕
You too!! Gnite 😙💕. 😘😘😘
Good morning 😘. My body is sore from yesterday lol
Hahahaha oops? :P. It seems like we need more practice 😋. What are you doing today?
Hehehe yes we do 😚 i just went running too so even more sore!. I am gonna do work today so i have nothing done 😞 ur working at school?
Oh wow!! I thought about running but didn't do it 😅. I'm buying groceries now 😓 so much fun... And it's such a beautiful day!!. I thought about going to the Maker Faire, but I don't think I have enough time 😞. I don't know, it was an option I was considering... Are you? :)
I know it is a beautiful day! I wanna be outside 😁😘. No i dont have time as well. I really wanna go to that thing i told u bout tnight so thats why i wanna work hard then go :)
:) that's a good plan. Are you gonna work at home or are going to the floor?
Gonna do it at home cause i also need to tidy up my very messy room 😂. What did u decide to do?
Hahahaha 😂. I rescind my &quot;beautiful day&quot; evaluation... It's so frigging hot!!! 😫🔥🔥🔥. I'll stay home as well... Hopefully I'll manage to cook something 😛. (and I'm having a beer, and probably will have some more he hehe). Are we meeting before this thing or can I kiss you when we see each other? :P. (I can wait until we're alone as well, but I really want to kiss you 　)
Yea i started sweating when i went outside 😂. oooo i forgot to mention. I liked ur cooking yesterday 😘 thank u for making breakfast. Hehe yes lets meet before i want to kiss u as well and i cant wait too long for that happen 😂😘. Im being patient but im slowly getting more and more impatient 😂😂
Hahaha yeah, I think running is not an option unless I want to disintegrate 😅. Awww thank you!! I think I have more ingredients now, so next time I could try something else :). 😁😁😁 I like that idea. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155805409874443.jpg" />. And look Google's recommendation to get there 😋
Hahaha i wanted to help u in the kitchen but u wanted to be the chef and take the spotlight! 😂😘. Yayyyyyy 😘😘 let me know when ur at metropolitan station then so i meet u there :). The G train likes us today
Heheheh sorry!!!! But I barely had any ingredients to work with 😅. We can cook together next time ;) (and that's something I tend to do without realizing... sorry!). I'll try to get to Metropolitan St ~4.15pm (I'll leave my place at 3.25)
Hehe its ok! It was cute! U seemed like u really like cooking so i was excited to try smthg of yours 😉 but yes i can show u my skills next time lol im not thatttt great tho. Ill be self conscious of what i make 😂. Yay! Okie sounds good 😘. They have a rule there for no phones on the dance floor 😂. Cash only at the door btw
I really like cooking for someone else 😁. Awww I'm sure it'll be delicious. 😚😚. Hahahaha that seems like a good rule! OK, I have some. I'm running a bit late. Just finished cooking. Got tempted with Pilar and we made mango-shrimp ceviche 😛
Omg that sounds amazing! 😍😍 im jealous hehe. And its okie take ur time. Im at a coffeeshop. Debating if i should go home and change. But yea let me know when ur close so i head back to my place
<p>Hahaha we can make another day. I love it and it's really simple 😉<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. Haha OK! I think I'll take a lyft so we can get there before 5pm
To my place or..?
Oh, that's a good idea!!. I'll brush my teeth and I'll be out. Send me your address
103 Havemeyer. :)
😊. 😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
U can take the train btw. Cause brandon sent me the email with the discount tickets. So no need to spend money on a lyft :*
But that way we'll have more time to kiss 😘😘😘. Oh well... Just got on the lyft 😅
Oh shoot im sorry. I thought u were still brushing ur teeth :(. But yay!! I cant wait 😘😘😘
Don't worry 😘😘😘💕. I'll be there in about ~8-10. 😘
Ok cool and we might need to leave immediately to the thing 😘😘
Ok!. Arriving :). I'm outside

Goodnight habibi 😘😘 see you tmr 😚
💕💕💕. Have a nice day habibti 😘💕
I just saw ur story!! U didnt sleep?! 😂😭. Thank u 😘
Barely 😭. I woke up at 1:15 and couldn't sleep, so I started working until like 4am. Took me a while until I could sleep again and woke up at 7:30 😩😢
Awww habibi thats really not good for youuu 😞
I know.... After cooking this morning I managed to &quot;sleep&quot; another hour
Ahhhhh please sleep tonight ❤️❤️ i want a healthy smiling nico 😘. Were u anxious bout schoolwork? Maybe thats why u couldnt sleep
Awww you're so cute 😍💕😘. But yeah, I'll try again tonight. And last night I wanted to sleep, I really did!! I spent more than an hour rolling on my bed trying to fall asleep again 😩. I dunno, not really... I feel like I have more time than last week. It'd be so useful to have a console on your body so you could debug yourself and see wtf is wrong 😂
Thats so strange! I wonder whats keeping u up. It happens to me too that i cant fall asleep or i wake up too early. But usually its anxiety bout school. Ill happily play doctor any day u want and debug ur body 😉😉😂😂. I usually wish i can just &quot;Ctrl + Z&quot; in life. The console would be helpful too
I think maybe I caught something :/ I'll drink a ton of water today to kick it out. Hehehehe I'll take that offer 😁😏. (Facebook needs a kinky look reaction :P). Hahaha the ctrl+z option would be awesome. I wanted to see you before your 12 class :/
Me too. My throat kinda feels itchy. Maybe we gave each other smthg 😂. Hehehe i wonder what kinky reaction u had in mind 😂. Im almost at school 😘 Waiting for the R. U there yet?
Hahahaha that seems highly likely 😛. <p><img src="messages/gifs/10155810974564443.gif" />. (that was accidentally pressed but works hahaha). Just took the F. It took forever 😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂 i love that kinky reaction. Ur so cute. It was a happy accident lol. Aww yay! But im in class 💔. <p>Ill come find u later<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>
Hahaha 😜. In which room are you?? I could sit somewhere you can see me 😚. Or better not... We'd both be distracted hahaha
Hehehe my back is facing the door and yes we would be distracted!! 😘😘. Ill find you ❤️ also i figured out the xposition issue for my text project last night! I feel very accomplished 😊
Yay!!! Go you 😃🙌🏼😘💕. 💕. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155811152064443.jpg" />. Look!!!

<p><img src="messages/gifs/1494192113998790.gif" />. 😂😂😂😂 me to you. very accurate. except im a darker bunny
😍😍😍😍. Hahahaha me too!. I'm just leaving ITP :P. Omg i bought so many things!! 🙈🙈🙈. I got so carried away
haha bought things from where?. wait are we going to this thing now? u didnt tell me the plan!!
Amazon and Adafruit. Omg sorry!! Peter plays at 8. I didn't send u the event on fb?
yes u did but i wasnt sure when you wanted to go hehe
(I'm going to make a laser harp for pcomp 😅). Oh hahaha. He plays at 8. After his band we can either stay for the next bands or we can leave
are u stopping by my place first so should i meet u at the knitting factory?
Hmm I think I'll stop by your place :). Getting on the L now. Can I leave my backpack there? 😋
cool. yep :)
😊
<p>also A LASER HARP?!<ul class="meta"><li>😆  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>
😘😘😘😘
ur ideas get crazier and crazier
😅. It's not that crazy!!! It already exists!!!
you need to help me with faking the news
Oki
the hardest part is concept. MERH. it exists but execution might also be very hard
Yeah, that's true... I'll have to work a bit harder for this one. Also, the mounting will definitely be harder. Luckily, the assignment for intro to fab is making an enclosure, so if I pull this off, I'll make both set the same time 😁. (I'm so smart). (OK, not)
yea maybe start on it a bit earlier and im sure u'll get it done. yea thats a good idea! a lot of itp people combine classes anyways. <p>u are smart &lt;3<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>
Well, this idea excites me a lot so I wanna get started asap In fact, I would've gladly stayed at ITP working 😂. Barak is also making a synth and is working on that right now. 3B, right?

Nah, just had 2 beers. Ooohhh and I ate currywurst😍. <p><img src="messages/photos/10155820613234443.jpg" />. Though it wasn't actual currywurst, but it was alright anyway. Hahahahahaha 😂. What have you been talking about??
Omg that looooooks so goood! Did u like the standard?. Talked bout a lot of unnecessary drama going on 😂. Still talking...
Yeah!!! It's a pretty cool place :D. 😂😂😂. Haha OK, I'll leave you to it and go to sleep 😜 have a good night and hopefully the drama will be rewritten as a successful novel or movie. Gnite beautiful 😘💖💕
I hope not. Its more of a sitcom 😂😂. Goodnight habibi 😘😘
Hahahahahaha 😂😂😂. Oh, and I remembered something... When I got to that place, I heard a Latin guy tell his friend (in Spanish) &quot;let's see how's the cattle&quot; 😡🔥 men are shit
Omg wowwww really sad to hear that stuff sometimes. I steer away from those men lol
Goodnight habibti 💕. Yeah, it's awful and infuriating 😞

Lolll im happy ur getting a lot of well deserved sleep 😘. Idk maybe after 12:30 i need help with the p5 speech library 😞. What are u getting her?. I have a pretty bad headache right now 😭
Hahaha I think I still need some more tho... But I'll get that later :P. Awwww. I'm sad I dunno anything about it, so I'm not sure if I could help u. I was thinking of getting her a nice notebook. Awww nooo habibti, take something for that!! I'll have the migraine medicine on my backpack in case it persists
<p>:p &quot;sexy cuddles&quot; time later tonight<ul class="meta"><li>😍  Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier</li></ul>. yea werent u gonna use it for ur harp project? or u were gonna use p5 sound... yea im asking utsav cause hes used this one im having the stupidest problem. yea maybe ill take advil i dont feel too great. i need to go to a sleep doctor!!!! lol. what time will u be at itp?
Nope, I'll use an arduino library, nothing to do with p5 there.... Hahahaha we can play &quot;doctor&quot; before we sleep 😏😁😘. But yeah, maybe go to one, that'd be smarter. Just take one!!! It's gonna make u feel better. Dunno, just had breakfast. I'll take a shower and get going I think.. Will get there in about an hour?

Hahahaha I didn't cook anything in the end. I'll try the udon soup near nyu. Hahahahahaha 😂😂😂 Uruguay awesome. *ur. (fucking autocorrect). And yeah, I know I have to watch Doctor Who, but it's a big time investment 😅

Check out the hackathon event I sent you. There are only 13 tickets left. If you're interested :P :*
Yea it looks cool and right before school really starts which is great. How much are tix?
Free if you participate in the hackathon. And the hackathon itself is also free but limited
Which one were u interested in?. Attending or participating?
Uh dunno... There were like 3 different events in fb. Oh, participating. <p>I think it could help for the portfolio, or at least get to know ppl<ul class="meta"><li>👍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. And also sounds fun 😁. And if they choose your project you can showcase it!! 😁
Yea i agree. My friend actually got a job through a hackathon. Pays her $90,000 a month in LA lol
😱😱😱
Hackathons always help ur portfolio. They re awesome
Me want that... NOW
Yea lol same
Yup, that's what I thought 😋
ahh ok theres 3 tix. on the 19th, its like listen to talks, network, and brainstorm ideas
Yup
on the 20th its the hackathon from 9AM-9PM
And the 20th is the hackathon. Yeah, that :P
tbh its always better to brainstorm ideas before so u dont waste time ideating
I got tickets for both
ive done that before
Osm!
and we couldnt fully finish. ohhh okie that was my question. ill do the same then
I got tickets for everything I could get 😅. Except the party cause it's free if you participate 😁. Free stuff ftw
wow it really sounds like a cool event
😊. Maybe we could be a team? 👀
i thought that was the whole suggestion!!!. 😭
Well, it was part of it, but I wanted to make sure 😅
Yes!! We should start brainstorming now 😁
Hahaha okie

😂😍😘😘😘
😂😂😂😂 they didn't have chilean but i liked the cuban and colombian one the best
😂😂. <p>Colombian is the best 💕<ul class="meta"><li>👍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. I also like the one from Costa Rica
dont know it!
<p>But the video has some catcalling/pick up lines 😔😒<ul class="meta"><li>👍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. Chilean accent is awful, really 😅
I thought u liked ur accent?. Lol
I mean, it's not baaaad... But we don't speak really well. And hey, I've said that tons of times
yes i know u've said that but i still thought u liked it. cause u said multiple times u miss speaking it in nyc. and that u can only speak it with sofia and other Chileans there
<p>Oh yeah, but it's more about something about identity and it's easier in the sense that it doesn't require any effort :P<ul class="meta"><li>👍  Nouf Aljowaysir</li></ul>. https://www.facebook.com/groups/ITP2019/permalink/536441770069409/. https://www.facebook.com/events/264535677414122/. https://asoftmurmur.com/
