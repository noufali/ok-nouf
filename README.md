# ok-nouf

How well does our behaviour online reflect who we really are? Can analyzing our digital footprints help us better understand ourselves?

ok-nouf is an installation that features a bot that will act as a copy of my digital self. She will be simulated from my online archives such as social media posts, Facebook messages, SMS interactions and more. She will be my self-reflective and interactive bot whose answers I can analyze to get a better picture of myself.
